# Missing-Values-and-Model-Accuracy
The project explores how various ways of handling missing values affect model accuracy

In this project I used a well studied dataset on Loan Predictions to explore the effects different ways of handling missing values affect model accuracy.

While model performance is more than just its acuracy, I thought it had to be affected differently if one filled in missing values in a dataset using the mean as opposed to say deleting the rows with missing features altogether.
